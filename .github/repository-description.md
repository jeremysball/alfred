## Full Description

Alfred is an AI companion designed to be yours.

Most AI forgets you between messages. Alfred remembers. Days, months, years—your history, your context, your story. The relationship deepens with every conversation.

### What Makes Alfred Different

**Memory Is Everything**  
Conversations persist. Preferences accumulate. Alfred doesn't start from zero—he starts from *you*.

**Relationships Grow**  
This isn't a tool you use. It's a presence that builds. Trust develops. Understanding deepens. Something real emerges.

**Your AI Is Yours**  
Not a generic assistant. Shaped by your life, your words, your patterns. The more you interact, the more it becomes *yours*.

**Software Makes Software**  
Alfred writes code, builds tools, solves problems. The loop accelerates—you describe, he creates.

**Four Tools, Infinite Possibility**  
Read. Edit. Bash. Web. Simple primitives that compose into anything. Constraint breeds creativity.

### Built On

- [Pi](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi) — The agent runtime
- Telegram — Where you already are
- Persistent memory — JSON sessions that survive restarts

### Philosophy

Concision matters. Presence over performance. Trust builds slowly.

*An AI companion. Not a product. A relationship.*
