# PRD: Research-Driven README Redesign with 3 Voice Variations

**Issue**: #78  
**Status**: Draft  
**Priority**: High  
**Created**: 2026-02-19

---

## Overview

Redesign Alfred's README through rigorous competitive research. Study 20 exemplary projects across categories, extract patterns, then craft three distinct README variations—each with a deliberate voice—plus a docs site landing page plan.

The goal: a README that genuinely excites visitors, communicates Alfred's unique value, and never uses an em-dash.

## Research Scope

### Categories & Project Count

| Category | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| AI Memory & Context | 5 | MemGPT, OpenClaw, LangMem, Zep, Vercel AI SDK |
| Developer Tools | 5 | Stripe CLI, GitHub CLI, Supabase, PostHog, Linear |
| Classic Open Source Stalwarts | 5 | Redis, PostgreSQL, nginx, curl, SQLite |
| Modern Visual AI Projects | 5 | Midjourney, Claude Code, Cursor, Warp, Raycast |

### Research Focus Areas

For each project, analyze:

1. **Hook**: First 3 seconds. What grabs attention?
2. **Structure**: Information hierarchy. What comes first? Second?
3. **Voice**: Tone, personality, formality level
4. **Visuals**: Screenshots, GIFs, diagrams, badges
5. **Social Proof**: Stars, testimonials, user counts, logos
6. **CTAs**: Install, docs, demo, join community
7. **Length**: Word count, section count, time to read
8. **Differentiation**: How do they stand out from competitors?

## Deliverables

### 1. Competitive Analysis Document
- One-page summary per project
- Pattern extraction across all 20
- Best practices synthesis

### 2. Three README Variations

| Variation | Voice | Inspiration |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| A | Technical but approachable | Supabase, Stripe docs |
| B | Playful/personality-driven | Raycast, Warp, Midjourney |
| C | Straight-to-the-point | Redis, SQLite, curl |

Each variation includes:
- Full README.md content
- Voice rationale document
- Visual recommendations (screenshots, diagrams)

### 3. Docs Site Landing Page Plan
- Structure and content outline
- Navigation recommendations
- Integration with main README

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 20 projects researched with structured notes
- [ ] Pattern analysis identifies 10+ actionable insights
- [ ] Three complete README variations written
- [ ] Each variation has distinct voice (validated by blind test)
- [ ] Docs site landing page plan complete
- [ ] Zero em-dashes in any deliverable

- Installation instructions that actually work
- Quick start vs. full documentation balance
- CLI output presentation

**Deliverable**: Research notes + pattern summary for category

---

### M3: Research Phase - Classic Open Source
Study 5 classic projects. Extract patterns for:
- Timeless clarity (why do these still work?)
- Technical depth without fluff
- Trust signals and stability messaging

**Deliverable**: Research notes + pattern summary for category

---

### M4: Research Phase - Modern Visual AI
Study 5 modern AI projects. Extract patterns for:

**Deliverable**: Research synthesis document

---

### M6: README Variation A - Technical but Approachable
Write complete README following Supabase/Stripe style:
- Clear hierarchy
- Progressive disclosure
- Warm but precise language
- Strong visual elements

**Deliverable**: `README-variation-A.md` + voice rationale

---

### M7: README Variation B - Playful/Personality-Driven
Write complete README following Raycast/Warp style:
- Distinct personality
- Emotional hooks
- Community focus
- Delightful details

**Deliverable**: `README-variation-B.md` + voice rationale

---

### M8: README Variation C - Straight-to-the-Point
Write complete README following Redis/SQLite style:
- Minimal words, maximum clarity
- Technical depth upfront
- No marketing fluff
- Trust through precision

**Deliverable**: `README-variation-C.md` + voice rationale

---

### M9: Docs Site Landing Page Plan
Create comprehensive plan:
- Page structure and content
- Navigation design
- README vs. docs relationship
- Implementation recommendations

**Deliverable**: `docs-site-landing-plan.md`

---

### M10: Final Review & Selection Support
Compile all deliverables. Provide:
- Side-by-side comparison of variations
- Selection framework (which voice for which audience)
- Implementation checklist for chosen variation

**Deliverable**: Final review document

---

## Constraints

- **Zero em-dashes** in any deliverable (use colons, periods, or restructure)
- **No puffery** (groundbreaking, revolutionary, seamless)
- **Show, don't tell** (visuals > adjectives)
- **Respect the competition** (these projects are impressive, learn from them)

---

## Timeline

No deadline pressure. Quality over speed. Each milestone represents meaningful research or creation work.

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-19 | 20 projects across 4 categories | Sufficient breadth for pattern extraction |
| 2026-02-19 | 3 voice variations | Gives real choice, covers major README archetypes |
| 2026-02-19 | Include docs site landing page | README is entry point, docs site is destination |
| 2026-02-19 | Zero em-dash constraint | User preference for cleaner punctuation |
