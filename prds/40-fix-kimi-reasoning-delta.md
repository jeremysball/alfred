# PRD: Fix Kimi reasoning_content Extraction from Streaming Delta

## Issue
#40

## Status
In Progress - Milestone 1 Complete

## Priority
High

## Problem Statement

Kimi API with thinking mode enabled requires `reasoning_content` to be present in assistant messages that have tool calls. Currently, `stream_chat_with_tools()` does not extract `reasoning_content` from the streaming response delta chunks. This causes API errors:

```
Error code: 400 - {'error': {'message': 'thinking is enabled but reasoning_content 
is missing in assistant tool call message at index 1', 'type': 'invalid_request_error'}}
```

## Root Cause

In `KimiProvider.stream_chat_with_tools()`, the code extracts:
- `delta.content` ✓
- `delta.tool_calls` ✓
- `delta.reasoning_content` ✗ (missing!)

When the agent constructs the assistant message with tool calls, it checks for `reasoning_content` but this was never populated because the streaming method didn't extract it from the delta.

## Solution Overview

Modify `stream_chat_with_tools()` to:
1. Extract `delta.reasoning_content` from each streaming chunk
2. Accumulate reasoning content across chunks
3. Include `reasoning_content` in the assistant message when tool calls are present

## Technical Details

### Current Flow (Broken)
```
Stream chunks → extract content + tool_calls
                ↓
        Assistant message created
                ↓
        NO reasoning_content
                ↓
        Next API call FAILS
```

### Fixed Flow
```
Stream chunks → extract content + tool_calls + reasoning_content
                ↓
        Assistant message with reasoning_content
                ↓
        Next API call SUCCEEDS
```

## Complete Tool Flow Architecture

Understanding the full tool execution flow is essential to understanding why `reasoning_content` extraction is critical.

### Example: User says "List files using bash"

```
STEP 1: USER INPUT
"List files in the current directory using the bash tool"
                        │
                        ▼
STEP 2: BUILD CONTEXT
Alfred loads system prompt + tool descriptions + memories
                        │
                        ▼
STEP 3: FIRST API CALL (stream_chat_with_tools)
Messages: [{role: "system", ...}, {role: "user", content: "List files..."}]
Tools: [{type: "function", function: {name: "bash", ...}}]
                        │
                        ▼
STEP 4: KIMI DECIDES TO USE TOOL
Kimi streams:
- delta.content = "" (empty)
- delta.reasoning_content = "The user wants me to list files..."
- delta.tool_calls = [{id: "tool_XYZ...", function: {name: "bash", ...}}]
                        │
                        ▼
STEP 5: LLM PROVIDER PROCESSES STREAM
stream_chat_with_tools() yields:
- "[REASONING]The user wants me to list files..."
- "[TOOL_CALLS][{id: "tool_XYZ...", ...}]"
                        │
                        ▼
STEP 6: AGENT PROCESSES MARKERS
Agent.run_stream():
- Accumulates reasoning_content
- Parses tool_calls_data
                        │
                        ▼
STEP 7: BUILD ASSISTANT MESSAGE
ChatMessage added:
{
  role: "assistant",
  content: "",
  tool_calls: [{id: "tool_XYZ...", type: "function", ...}],
  reasoning_content: "The user wants me to list files..."  ← CRITICAL!
}
                        │
                        ▼
STEP 8: EXECUTE TOOL
Tool "bash" runs: subprocess → "ls -la"
Output: "drwxr-xr-x..."
                        │
                        ▼
STEP 9: ADD TOOL RESULT
ChatMessage added:
{
  role: "tool",
  content: "drwxr-xr-x...",
  tool_call_id: "tool_XYZ..."  ← Links to the tool_call
}
                        │
                        ▼
STEP 10: SECOND API CALL (4 messages now)
1. {role: "system", ...}
2. {role: "user", content: "List files..."}
3. {role: "assistant", tool_calls: [...], reasoning_content: "..."}
4. {role: "tool", content: "drwxr-xr-x...", tool_call_id: "tool_XYZ..."}

⚠️  WITHOUT reasoning_content → 400 ERROR
✅ WITH reasoning_content → 200 OK
                        │
                        ▼
STEP 11: FINAL RESPONSE
Kimi: "Here are the files in the current directory..."
```

### Key Elements

| Element | Source | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `tool_call_id` | Generated by Kimi API | Links tool result to the specific tool call |
| `reasoning_content` | Generated by Kimi (thinking mode) | Required when tool_calls present in thinking mode |
| `tool_calls` | Model decides what to call | Tells us which tools to execute |
| `messages` array | We build this | Complete conversation history for API |

### The Bug in Context

Before the fix, Step 7 didn't include `reasoning_content`, so Step 10 failed with:
```
400 - thinking is enabled but reasoning_content is missing
      in assistant tool call message at index 1
```

After the fix, `stream_chat_with_tools()` extracts `delta.reasoning_content` and yields `[REASONING]` markers, which the agent accumulates and includes in the assistant message, allowing Step 10 to succeed.

## Implementation Plan

### Milestone 1: Fix reasoning_content Extraction
- [x] Modify `stream_chat_with_tools()` to extract `delta.reasoning_content`
- [x] Accumulate reasoning content across streaming chunks
- [x] Ensure reasoning_content is passed through in assistant messages with tool calls
- [x] Verify fix with manual test (CLI tool execution successful, no 400 error)

### Milestone 2: Testing Strategy Evaluation
- [ ] Evaluate current test coverage for streaming with tool calls
- [ ] Determine if new tests are needed for reasoning_content
- [ ] Document testing approach decision

### Milestone 3: Regression Testing
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Verify no existing functionality broken
- [ ] Verify integration tests pass

## Success Criteria
- [x] Tool calls work with Kimi API when thinking mode is enabled
- [x] `stream_chat_with_tools()` correctly extracts and propagates reasoning_content
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests with real LLM pass

## Testing Strategy Decision

**Decision**: Option B - Rely on integration tests, document the requirement

**Rationale**:
- This is provider-specific behavior (Kimi thinking mode) that doesn't generalize to other providers
- Unit tests would require complex mocking of streaming deltas with reasoning_content
- Integration tests with real API properly validate the full flow
- Documented requirement in code comments will guide future maintainers

**Action Items**:
- [x] Add code comment in `stream_chat_with_tools()` documenting reasoning_content extraction requirement
- [ ] Ensure integration tests cover tool calls with streaming

- `src/agent.py` - Agent loop that constructs assistant messages

## Dependencies

|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-18 | PRD Created | Fix required for Kimi tool calls with thinking mode |
| 2026-02-18 | Testing Strategy: Option B | Rely on integration tests, document requirement - provider-specific behavior not suited for unit tests |
