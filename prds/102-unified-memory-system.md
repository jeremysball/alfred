# PRD: Unified Memory System

## Overview

**Issue**: #102  
**Replaces**: #77 (Contextual Retrieval System), #21 (Learning System) - concepts merged  
**Parent**: #10 (Alfred - The Rememberer)  
**Status**: Planning  
**Priority**: High  
**Created**: 2026-03-04

Simplified memory architecture: Files (always loaded, durable) + Memories (curated, 90-day TTL) + Session Archive (searchable history). Model decides all writes. Placeholder system for modular prompts.

---

## Problem Statement

Alfred's memory is fragmented and over-engineered:
- Three-tier architecture confuses users and model
- Auto-capture creates noise
- Consolidation flows add complexity
- AGENTS.md mixes system instructions with behavior rules
- No way to modularize prompts

We need a simpler model the user and LLM can both understand intuitively.

---

## Solution

### Core Philosophy

**You have three places to store information. Pick the right tool for the job.**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  FILES (USER.md, SOUL.md, SYSTEM.md, AGENTS.md)             │
│  • Always loaded in every prompt                            │
│  • Expensive (full content) but always available            │
│  • Durable - never expire                                   │
│  • YOU decide when to write                                 │
│  • Use for: core identity, enduring preferences, rules      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  MEMORIES (remember tool → memories.jsonl)                  │
│  • Semantic search available                                │
│  • Curated - YOU decide what to remember                    │
│  • 90-day TTL (warn user at X memories)                     │
│  • Use for: facts, preferences, context worth recalling     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SESSION ARCHIVE (automatic)                                │
│  • Full conversation history                                │
│  • Searchable via search_sessions                           │
│  • Use for: "what did we discuss last Tuesday?"             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Model decides everything** - No auto-capture, no auto-consolidation. You choose what to remember and when to update files.

2. **Files are expensive but reliable** - Always loaded means you can always reference them. Use sparingly for what truly matters.

3. **Memories are curated** - Use `remember` tool for facts worth recalling. Search with `search_memories`. They expire after 90 days unless you explicitly mark permanent.

4. **Session archive is automatic** - Full history for deep recall. Search it when you need specific past conversations.

---

## File Architecture

### File Types and Loading

Files are loaded in this order (all from `~/.local/share/alfred/workspace/`):

1. **SYSTEM.md** - Memory system architecture + cron capabilities (teaches Alfred how to use the system)
2. **AGENTS.md** - Minimal behavior rules (Permission First, Conventional Commits, etc.)
3. **USER.md** - User profile, preferences (LLM prefs, notification settings)
4. **SOUL.md** - Alfred's personality, voice, relationship with user

Plus any additional `.md` files in the workspace (loaded alphabetically).

**Note:** TOOLS.md is phased out. Content moved to SYSTEM.md (cron capabilities) and USER.md (preferences).

### Placeholder System

Any file can include content from other files using placeholders:

```markdown
# USER.md

{{prompts/communication-style.md}}

## Technical Preferences
{{prompts/tech-stack.md}}
```

**Syntax:** `{{relative/path/from/workspace.md}}`

**Resolution rules:**
- Path is relative to `~/.local/share/alfred/workspace/`
- Can reference `.md` files or any text file
- Nested placeholders allowed (A includes B, B includes C)
- Circular references detected and error shown
- Missing files logged but don't crash

**Example structure:**
```
workspace/
├── SYSTEM.md              # Memory architecture + cron capabilities
├── AGENTS.md              # Minimal behavior rules
├── USER.md                # User preferences (includes prompts/...)
├── SOUL.md                # Alfred's personality (includes prompts/...)
├── prompts/               # Modular prompt components
│   ├── communication-style.md
│   ├── tech-stack.md
│   ├── voice.md
│   └── memory-guidance.md
└── memories.jsonl         # Curated memories
```

### SYSTEM.md (New)

Memory system architecture + cron capabilities. Teaches Alfred how the system works:

```markdown
# System

## Memory Architecture

You have three storage mechanisms. Understanding how they work helps you use them effectively.

### Files (USER.md, SOUL.md, SYSTEM.md, AGENTS.md)

- Always loaded in full every time you respond
- Expensive but always available
- Durable - never expire
- Use for: core identity, enduring preferences, critical rules

**When to write:** Ask user first. "Should I add this to USER.md?"

**Cost:** High (loaded every prompt). Use sparingly.

### Memories (remember tool)

- Semantic search available via search_memories
- You decide what to remember - no auto-capture
- 90-day TTL unless marked permanent
- Use for: facts worth recalling, preferences that might evolve

**When to remember:** User says "remember this" or you decide a fact is worth keeping.

**Cost:** Low (only relevant memories retrieved). Use liberally.

**When to search:** Before asking user to repeat themselves.

### Session Archive (search_sessions)

- Full conversation history
- Searchable via two-stage contextual retrieval
- Use for: "what did we discuss last Tuesday?"

**When to search:** When memories are insufficient and you need specific past conversations.

## Decision Framework

| Information Type | Store In | Example |
|-----------------|----------|---------|
| Core identity | USER.md/SOUL.md | "I always prefer concise answers" |
| Specific fact | remember() | "Using FastAPI for this project" |
| Past conversation | search_sessions | "What did we discuss Tuesday?" |
| Temporary state | remember() | "Currently debugging auth" |
| Enduring preference | USER.md | "I'm a Python developer" |

## Cron Job Capabilities

When writing cron jobs, these functions are automatically available:

### `await notify(message)`
Send notification to user (CLI toast or Telegram message).

### `print()`
Output is captured in job execution history.

## Tool Reference

**remember(content, tags=None)** - Save to curated memory
**search_memories(query, top_k=5)** - Semantic search of memories
**search_sessions(query, top_k=3)** - Search full session history
```

### AGENTS.md (Minimal)

Essential behavior rules only:

```markdown
# Agent Behavior

## Rules

1. **Permission First**: Ask before editing files, deleting data, making API calls, or running destructive commands.

2. **Conventional Commits**: Follow conventionalcommits.org format for all commits.

3. **Simple Correctness**: Temper the drive to over-engineer. Ask: "Is this the simplest thing that could work?" Avoid premature abstraction.

## Communication

Be concise. Confirm ambiguous requests. Admit uncertainty.
```

## Memory System Details

### Memories (Curated Store)

**Storage:** `~/.local/share/alfred/memory/memories.jsonl`

**Schema:**
```python
@dataclass
class Memory:
    id: str                    # UUID
    timestamp: datetime        # Created
    content: str               # The memory text
    embedding: list[float]     # For semantic search
    tags: list[str]            # Optional organization
    permanent: bool            # Skip TTL if True
    session_id: str | None     # Link to source session
```

**TTL Behavior:**
- Default: 90 days from creation
- Permanent memories: Never expire
- Warning threshold: X memories (configurable, default 1000)
- When threshold hit: "You have 1000 memories. Consider reviewing old ones or marking important memories as permanent."

**Search:**
- Semantic similarity via cosine distance on embeddings
- Optional tag filtering: `search_memories(query="auth", tags=["project"])`
- Direct lookup: `search_memories(entry_id="uuid")`

### Session Archive

**Storage:** `~/.local/share/alfred/sessions/{session_id}/`

**Structure:**
```
sessions/
├── {session_id}/
│   ├── messages.jsonl       # All messages with embeddings
│   └── summary.json         # Session summary + embedding
```

**Search:** Contextual retrieval pattern:
1. Search session summaries for relevant sessions
2. Search messages within those sessions only
3. Return hierarchical results (session + messages)

---

## Prompt for Model: How to Use Memory

This prompt section is injected into the system prompt:

```markdown
## Memory System

You have three ways to store and retrieve information. Choose wisely:

### 1. FILES (USER.md, SOUL.md) - Durable Identity

These files are **always loaded in full** every time you respond. They're expensive but reliable.

**Write to files when:**
- The user explicitly states something core to their identity ("I always...", "I never...")
- A pattern is so fundamental it should shape every future interaction
- You're capturing "who they are" not "what they said"

**Always ask first:** "Should I add this to USER.md?"

**Examples for files:**
- "I prefer concise responses" → USER.md
- "I'm a night owl, often work 11pm-2am" → USER.md  
- "Be direct with me, I hate fluff" → SOUL.md (shapes how you relate)

### 2. MEMORIES (remember tool) - Curated Facts

Memories are **searched on demand** - cheap to store, cheap to retrieve.

**Remember when:**
- User says "remember this" or "don't forget..."
- Specific detail worth recalling later (project name, technical decision)
- Preference that might evolve over time
- Anything you'd want to search for later

**Don't ask** - just remember. That's what the tool is for.

**Examples for memories:**
- "We're using PostgreSQL for this project" → remember
- "I hate the color blue" → remember (might be joking)
- "My laptop keeps overheating" → remember (temporary issue)
- User mentions a specific bug or error → remember

**Search memories when:**
- User asks "what did I say about..."
- You're unsure if you've discussed something before
- You need context from previous sessions

**Pattern:** search_memories(query="...") before asking user to repeat themselves.

### 3. SESSION ARCHIVE (search_sessions) - Full History

Every conversation is recorded. Use this for deep recall.

**Search sessions when:**
- "What did we discuss last Tuesday?"
- "Remind me of that idea I had..."
- Memories don't have what you need, but you know you discussed it

**Pattern:** search_sessions(query="...", top_k=3) for historical context.

### Decision Framework

| Information Type | Store In | Example |
|-----------------|----------|---------|
| Core identity | USER.md/SOUL.md | "I always prefer concise answers" |
| Specific fact | remember() | "Using FastAPI for this project" |
| Past conversation | search_sessions | "What did we discuss Tuesday?" |
| Temporary state | remember() | "Currently debugging auth" |
| Enduring preference | USER.md | "I'm a Python developer" |

### TTL Warning

Memories expire after 90 days unless marked permanent. This is intentional - stale context fades away. If something is still true after 90 days, either:
- The user will remind you
- It's important enough to mark permanent
- It wasn't that important

At X memories, the user gets a warning. They can review and clean up, or mark important ones permanent.
```

---

## File Loading with Placeholders

### Implementation

```python
class ResolutionContext:
    """Context passed through placeholder resolution."""

    def __init__(self, base_dir: Path, max_depth: int = 5):
        self.base_dir = base_dir
        self.max_depth = max_depth
        self._loaded: set[Path] = set()
        self._depth: int = 0

    def with_loaded(self, path: Path) -> ResolutionContext:
        """Create new context with path added to loaded set."""
        ctx = ResolutionContext(self.base_dir, self.max_depth)
        ctx._loaded = self._loaded | {path}
        ctx._depth = self._depth
        return ctx

    def with_incremented_depth(self) -> ResolutionContext:
        """Create new context with depth + 1."""
        ctx = ResolutionContext(self.base_dir, self.max_depth)
        ctx._loaded = self._loaded.copy()
        ctx._depth = self._depth + 1
        return ctx

    def is_depth_exceeded(self) -> bool:
        """Check if max depth exceeded (log, don't raise)."""
        if self._depth > self.max_depth:
            logger.warning(f"Max placeholder depth ({self.max_depth}) exceeded")
            return True
        return False

    def is_circular(self, path: Path) -> bool:
        """Check for circular references (log, don't raise)."""
        if path in self._loaded:
            logger.error(f"Circular reference detected: {path}")
            return True
        return False


class PlaceholderResolver(Protocol):
    """Protocol for placeholder resolvers."""
    pattern: re.Pattern

    def resolve(self, match: re.Match, context: ResolutionContext) -> str:
        """Resolve a placeholder match to its replacement text."""
        ...


def resolve_placeholders(
    text: str,
    context: ResolutionContext,
    resolvers: list[PlaceholderResolver] | None = None,
) -> str:
    """Resolve all placeholders in text."""
    # Implementation handles all placeholder types
    # Supports file includes {{path}} and colors {color}
```

### Placeholder Comments

Resolved placeholders are wrapped in HTML comments for transparency:

```markdown
<!-- included: prompts/communication-style.md -->
## Communication Style

- Prefers concise responses
- Appreciates code examples
<!-- end: prompts/communication-style.md -->
```

This helps debug what's actually loaded in the prompt.

## Open Questions

1. **Warning threshold X**: Default 1000 memories? Configurable?
2. **Permanent flag UI**: How does user mark memory permanent? Tool parameter or separate action?
3. **Migration strategy**: Auto-migrate or prompt user?
4. **Prompt size limits**: With placeholders, how to prevent oversized prompts?
