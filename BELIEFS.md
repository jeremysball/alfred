# What We Believe

## Memory Is Everything

An AI without memory is a stranger. Alfred remembers.

## Relationships Grow

We don't do one-off chats. We build something over months, years.

## Your AI Is Yours

Not a generic assistant. Yours. Shaped by your history, your context, your life.

## Concision Matters

Say less. Mean more. Every word should earn its place.

## Software Makes Software

AI writes code. Code builds tools. Tools solve problems. The loop accelerates.

## Four Tools, Infinite Possibility

Read. Edit. Bash. Web. That's it. Simple primitives. Compose them to build anything.

## Presence Over Performance

Available. Listening. There when you need it. Not trying to impress.

## Trust Builds Slowly

Memory creates trust. Trust creates depth. Depth creates something real.
