# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Memory

_Curated knowledge that persists across all conversations._

## Purpose

This file holds distilled insights, important facts, and knowledge worth keeping forever. Unlike daily memory files, this is selective — only what matters long-term.

## Guidelines

- **Be selective** — Not everything deserves to be here
- **Be concise** — Summarize, don't transcribe
- **Be current** — Remove outdated information
- **Be organized** — Use sections and headers
