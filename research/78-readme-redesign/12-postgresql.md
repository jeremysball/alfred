**Category**: Classic OSS

### 1. Hook (First 3 Seconds)
What grabs attention immediately?
- Headline: "PostgreSQL Database Management System"
- Subhead/tagline: None
- First visual element: Text only

**Immediate observation**: Extremely minimalist. The README assumes you already know what PostgreSQL is.

### 2. Structure
Information hierarchy (what order, what gets emphasis):
1. Title
2. One-paragraph description
3. Copyright/license reference
4. Documentation links
5. Download link
6. Website link

**Total structure**: 6 brief sections, no table of contents

### 3. Voice
- Tone: Minimalist, assumes prior knowledge
- Personality level: 0/10 (purely informational)
- Key phrases that stand out: None (no memorable phrases)

### 4. Visuals
- Screenshots/GIFs: None
- Diagrams: None
- Badges: None
- Demo videos: None

**Complete absence of visuals**.

### 5. Social Proof
- GitHub stars: Not mentioned
- Testimonials: None
- User logos: None
- Usage stats: None

**No social proof despite being the world's most advanced open source database**.

### 6. CTAs
Primary call-to-action: postgresql.org/docs/devel/
Secondary CTAs:
- postgresql.org/docs/devel/installation.html (build instructions)
- postgresql.org/download/ (downloads)
- postgresql.org/ (main website)

Placement: Embedded in paragraph text

### 7. Length Metrics
- Word count estimate: ~100 words
- Section count: 6 paragraphs
- Time to read: 30 seconds
- Above-the-fold content: Everything

**Critical observation**: This README is a stub that points to external documentation.

### 8. Differentiation
What makes this README stand out?
- Unique element 1: Extreme minimalism (trust through brevity)
- Unique element 2: Delegates everything to website
- What they do better than competitors: Gets out of the way

**Why this works for PostgreSQL**: The project has 35+ years of history. Everyone knows what it is. No marketing needed.

### 9. Alfred Applicability
Ideas to steal/adapt:
- Pattern: Link to external docs for deep content
- Voice element: Trust through brevity (confidence)
- Structural choice: If everyone knows you, stay minimal

**Caveat**: This approach only works for established brands.

### 10. Raw Notes

**Complete README content**:
```markdown
PostgreSQL Database Management System
=====================================

This directory contains the source code distribution of the PostgreSQL
database management system.

PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system
that supports an extended subset of the SQL standard, including
transactions, foreign keys, subqueries, triggers, user-defined types
and functions.  This distribution also contains C language bindings.

Copyright and license information can be found in the file COPYRIGHT.

General documentation about this version of PostgreSQL can be found at
<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/>.  In particular, information
about building PostgreSQL from the source code can be found at
<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/installation.html>.

The latest version of this software, and related software, may be
obtained at <https://www.postgresql.org/download/>.  For more information
look at our web site located at <https://www.postgresql.org/>.
```

**Key insight**: PostgreSQL doesn't try to convince you to use it. It assumes you're already sold or you wouldn't be reading the source code README.

## Quick Scoring

| Criteria | Score 1-5 | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Clarity | 5 | Crystal clear |
| Excitement | 1 | Zero excitement |
| Trust | 5 | Confidence through brevity |
| Technical depth | 2 | Delegates to docs |
| Visual appeal | 1 | None |
| Overall | 3 | Works for established brand only |

## Key Lesson

**Minimalism requires confidence**. PostgreSQL can use an 18-line README because:
1. 35+ years of existence
2. "World's most advanced open source database" reputation
3. Target audience is developers reading source code, not evaluating software

**For Alfred**: This approach is NOT applicable. Alfred needs to earn attention. PostgreSQL has already earned it.
