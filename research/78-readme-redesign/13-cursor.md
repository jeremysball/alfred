## 9. Alfred Applicability

### Patterns to steal:

**Skip entirely**:
- This is too minimal for Alfred
- Alfred needs explanation, not just redirect

**Note**:

## Key Takeaway for Alfred

Cursor proves that **extreme minimalism works only with massive brand recognition**. For lesser-known projects like Alfred, this approach would fail.

For Alfred: Don't copy this. Use patterns from Warp, PostHog, or Vercel instead.
