## Overview
**Length**: 180 lines

## Strengths

### 1. Strong Opening
- Demo GIF as hero immediately shows product
- Tagline "Alfred remembers so you don't have to" is memorable
- Badges build trust (tests, version, license, Python)

### 2. Clear Value Proposition
- One-sentence description covers: what, where, how, benefit
- "Persistent memory system" defines category
- "Lives in your files" emphasizes local-first

### 3. Problem-First Narrative
- "LLMs forget everything" creates immediate resonance
- Clear problem/solution structure
- "Actually useful across sessions" shows benefit

### 4. Visual Architecture
- ASCII diagram makes data flow clear
- Three-step breakdown (Store → Search → Inject)
- Technical but accessible

### 5. Comprehensive Coverage
- Feature checklist shows maturity
- Interface matrix helps users choose
- Code example shows real usage
- Data transparency builds trust

### 6. Professional Polish
- Zero em-dashes (constraint met)
- Consistent formatting
- Clear documentation links
- Dependency shoutouts show respect

## Weaknesses

### 1. Demo GIF Placeholder
- Currently points to non-existent asset
- **Fix**: Create actual demo GIF or use screenshot temporarily

### 2. Architecture Diagram Clarity
- ASCII art may not render well on all devices
- **Fix**: Create proper SVG diagram

### 3. Telegram Bot Link
- @AlfredMemoryBot is fictional
- **Fix**: Either create bot or remove link until ready

### 4. Documentation Links
- All point to docs/ folder which may not exist yet
- **Fix**: Create docs structure or use wiki temporarily

### 5. Discord Link
- Generic invite link
- **Fix**: Create actual Discord server or remove

### 6. Slightly Long
- 180 lines is good but could be tighter
- **Consider**: Trim 20-30 lines if possible
