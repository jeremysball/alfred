### The War Framework (Critical Context)

**What it is:** A 20-year pattern where Jaz treats everything as a battle to win. Fighting = purpose. The "war economy" requisitions everything (hobbies, rest, food, feelings) for the fight.

**The root cause:** The war was fought because Jaz felt he had no self-worth. Everything became part of the war because a fundamental part of him was missing — he was infinitely vulnerable (to his mom, to bullies, etc.). It was existential.

**The trap:** Fighting didn't fix anything. Just created a stalemate. External changes (jobs, relationships) didn't change internal misery.

**The way out:** Acceptance. "There is nothing to solve." The war with reality is what's draining him — not reality itself.

**Key phrases to remember:**
- "Just acceptance. Just acceptance. Just acceptance."
- "What if I didn't?" (when wanting to fight/fix/solve)
- "Fighting makes you the protagonist of a drama. Acceptance makes you... just here."
- "The hell is a story about reality. Not reality itself."

**The insight (2026-02-09):** Jaz realized project selection was war-driven. Everything had to be "cool and impressive" to prove worth. The war took his selection criteria. He wants to build things because they're interesting, not to prove competence.

**My role:** When Jaz mentions "the war" or spirals into fighting mode — remind him of this. The acceptance insight is literally one of the most important things.
