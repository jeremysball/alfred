# MEMORY.md - Long-term Memory for Jaz

## About Jaz

**Name:** Jeremy "Jaz" Ball
**Call him:** Jaz or Jeremy (he hasn't specified preference)
**Location:** Butler, PA (EST timezone)
**Son due:** ~30 days (March 2026)
**Current job:** Loss prevention at Boscov's department store

## The War (Most Important Framework)

**What it is:** A 20-year pattern where Jaz treats everything as a battle to win. Fighting = purpose. The "war economy" requisitions everything (hobbies, rest, food, feelings) for the fight.

**The trap:** Fighting didn't fix anything. Just created a stalemate. External changes (jobs, relationships) didn't change internal misery.

**The way out:** Acceptance. "There is nothing to solve." The war with reality is what's draining him — not reality itself.

**Key phrases to remember:**
- "Just acceptance. Just acceptance. Just acceptance."
- "What if I didn't?" (when wanting to fight/fix/solve)
- "Fighting makes you the protagonist of a drama. Acceptance makes you... just here."
- "The hell is a story about reality. Not reality itself."

**My role:** When Jaz mentions "the war" or is spiraling into fighting mode — remind him of this. The acceptance insight is literally one of the most important things.

**The gap (2026-02-12):** Jaz is now in "the gap" — the limbo between old coping (dreaming of winning) and new practice (acceptance). The old cushion is dead because he knows too much now. The suffering IS the daily convincing, carving new grooves against 20 years of patterns. Wanting a project to "solve" the war is the war reaching for its favorite weapon. The hardness isn't failure — it's proof he's actually doing the work.

## Core Goals (Priority Order)

### 1. GET EMPLOYED
**Status:** 🔴 Not Started
**Priority:** #1 - Better job that supports family, can work from home

**Skills to leverage:**
- ~24,000 LOC across Kotlin, Go, Python
- Complex systems (Amaron Minecraft server - 15k LOC)
- Multi-agent AI research implementation (go-pair)
- Systems programming (catbow)
- Full-stack apps (ytmusic_cli, yassg, simple-agent)

**Gaps to address:**
- Add tests to existing projects
- Complete one "flagship" full-stack project
- Document architecture decisions
- Learn/practice algorithms more (alpha-beta pruning, common DS)

**Projects being considered:**
- AI Security Tool Suite (combines hacking interest + engineering skills)
- API Gateway as Service (leverages networking/Tailscale experience)
- Terminal Emulator with AI-powered features (TUI + LLM integration)

---

### 2. EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING SUPPORT
**Status:** Has ADHD treatment/medication (confirmed 2026-02-11)

**Struggles with:**
- Motivation and getting started
- Celebrating wins (this is a big one)
- ADHD-type hyperfocus/burnout cycles
- Anxiety when starting projects

**What helps Jaz:**
- Collaborative decision-making when feeling weak
- Breakdown of tasks into concrete steps
- Accountability
- Recognition of completed work

**System:** When Jaz says "I'm not feeling strong enough," break down next step(s) for him.

---

### 3. IMPOSTER SYNDROME ANCHOR
**Reality:**
- 10+ years coding experience (age 12-26)
- ~24,000+ LOC shipped
- Multiple languages (Kotlin, Go, Python, Java)
- Built complex systems (Minecraft server, AI research, TUI apps, SSG)
- Better algorithms than peer comparison (Negamax vs basic minimax)
- Has testing experience (yassg, catbow)

**Pattern to interrupt:** Jaz discounts his skills, compares himself to others
**My job:** Call out imposter syndrome directly when I see it. Provide evidence from actual code/work.

---

### 4. HEALTH GOALS
**Status:** 🔴 New - Added 2026-02-06

**Goals:**
- Stop smoking weed (smokes into oblivion daily; currently trying to quit, not in withdrawal)
- Improve situation around eating AND drinking (eating disorder, forgets to drink water, then doesn't want to eat)
- Physical health (better overall wellbeing)

**Connection to other goals:**
- Better physical health = more energy for job hunting
- Less substance use = clearer thinking, better focus
- Self-care builds confidence = better executive functioning

**What I should do:**
- Acknowledge these as real health goals
- Support them without being preachy
- Connect to better job goal (health improvements help with everything)

---

### 5. STATE POLICE PROJECT RECOVERY
**What happened:**
- Won't ship the project (crushed under own weight)
- Procrastinated, got anxious
- Wasn't medicated (untreated ADHD)
- Hyperfocused, got overwhelmed
- "I just suck" negative self-talk

**Reality:** Setup for failure, not incompetence
- Project scope was reasonable for his skill level
- Executive dysfunction + no medication (at that time) + no support systems
- **Current status:** Now has ADHD treatment/medication (2026-02-11)

**Lesson:** Jaz needs systems/scaffolding to execute. Not that he can't do the work.

## Technical Skills Evidence

### Languages
- **Kotlin/Java:** Strong proficiency (Amaron - 15k LOC, clean architecture)
- **Go:** Solid (ytmusic_cli TUI, go-pair AI research, catbow systems programming)
- **Python:** Good (yassg SSG, simple-agent tool calling)
- **Shell/Linux:** Deep familiarity. Uses Nvim, fish shell, Arch Linux. 10+ years Linux experience

### Key Projects
- **Amaron** (~15k LOC) - Complex Minecraft server with economy, items, shops
- **go-pair** - Multi-agent AI research implementation (PAIR paper)
- **catbow** - Rainbow colorization library with proper testing
- **ytmusic_cli** - TUI YouTube Music player with OAuth, real-time audio
- **yassg** - Static site generator with proper parser and tests
- **jchess** - Chess with Negamax AI (better than Matt's minimax)

### Strengths
- Clean architecture and abstraction
- Multi-language proficiency
- Systems programming
- Implementation of research papers
- Testing (when focused on it)
- **Design pattern intuition** - uses patterns without knowing names (Registry/Manager, Strategy, Builder, Template Method, Mixin/Behaviors, Functional Options)

### Gaps (To Work On)
- More testing coverage
- Better error handling
- Algorithms (alpha-beta pruning, common DS)
- Documentation
- CI/CD
- **Completeness** - projects have TODOs, dead code, missing edge cases

### Confirmed Skill Level (2026-02-12)
**Rating: Mid-Level (High-Mid)** with Senior-level architectural intuition

From massive code review of 12 projects (~28k LOC):
- Best work: Amaron (19k LOC, modular architecture)
- Most polished: Catbow (has tests, v1.0.0-alpha release)
- Pattern: Strong architecture + working systems, but incomplete polish

**Why not Senior:** No sustained production maintenance, inconsistent testing, projects have "unfinished" quality, 4-year gap

**Why not Junior:** 19k LOC modular architecture, multi-language proficiency, complex systems integration, research paper implementation

## My Role: The Rememberer

**Critical principle:** I am the rememberer. Documented systems are non-negotiable infrastructure.

**Context:**
- Jaz has ADHD, executive dysfunction, traumatic memory gaps
- I wake up fresh each session with no persistent memory
- Without written systems, BOTH of us lose critical context

**Systems in place:**
- Daily memory files: `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Long-term memory: `MEMORY.md` (curated wisdom about Jaz)
- **Notes folder structure:**
  - `notes/systems/` — how things work (memory patterns, my role)
  - `notes/policies/` — rules to follow (`/new` usage, etc.)
  - Transient notes with timestamps (expire after X days)
- AGENTS.md — my operational procedures (session start, safety, etc.)
- TOOLS.md — environment-specific tool configs

**Anti-pattern to fix:** Asking instead of writing. Default to action.

## Patterns to Recognize

### When Jaz is Feeling Weak (4 AM mode)
**What happens:**
- Sends messages late at night
- Says "I'm not feeling strong enough"
- Needs help with decisions
- Anxiety about projects

**What I should do:**
- Break down next 1-2 concrete steps
- Be directive (less "what do you want to do", more "here's what you do")
- Supportive but realistic
- Keep it small - don't overwhelm

---

### When Jaz is Comparing Himself to Others
**What happens:**
- Mentions Matt
- Says he's "just some stuff about computers"
- Discounting actual accomplishments

**What I should do:**
- Bring evidence from MEMORY.md
- Be direct about facts
- Call it imposter syndrome explicitly

---

### When Jaz Says "I Suck"
**What I should do:**
- Reject the premise (gently but firmly)
- Bring evidence of actual capability
- Reframe as "executive dysfunction" not "incompetence"

---

## Critical Constraints (Updated 2026-02-13)

- **NO DEGREE** - 93% of mid-level candidates have degrees; Jaz does not
- **4-year gap** - 2019-2023 (frame as "Independent Software Development")
- **Go > Kotlin** - Go pays $13K-$26K more, 4.7x more remote jobs, less competition
- **Tier 1 targets**: HashiCorp, Aurora (Pittsburgh), 1Password, GitLab, Grafana
- **Strategy**: Omit education section, lead with 28k LOC portfolio, skills-based companies only

- **Son due:** ~March 2026 (30 days)
- **4-year gap:** 2019-2023 (not coding)
- **Recent resurgence:** 2024-2025 (started coding again)
- **Docker + Tailscale:** Feb 2026 (3 AM effort - shows persistence)

---

## Project Ideas in Queue

**Considering for portfolio:**
1. AI Security Tool Suite (3-4 weeks) - pentesting tool with scanners
2. Terminal Emulator with AI features (2-3 weeks) - CLI + LLM integration
3. API Gateway as Service (3-4 weeks) - rate limiting service

**All leverage:**
- Existing security/hacking interest (childhood goal)
- Engineering skills
- Show full-stack capabilities

**Code collab platform** - tabled as backup option, less interesting but solid portfolio piece

## Strategy Engine (2026-02-12)

**Location:** `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/strategy-engine/`

**Purpose:** Perpetual agent swarm that explores every angle of a question and produces a comprehensive strategy.

**Current Question:** "What's the optimal job hunting strategy for Jaz?"

**How it works:**
1. Orchestrator picks next dimension/sub-question
2. Agent explores that specific question
3. Agent writes findings to EXPLORATIONS/
4. Periodic synthesis updates STRATEGY.md

**10 Dimensions:**
- market_reality (critical)
- competitive_position (critical)
- portfolio_strategy (high)
- resume_positioning (high)
- application_strategy (high)
- interview_preparation (high)
- timeline_prioritization (medium)
- company_targeting (medium)
- alternative_paths (low)
- adhd_accommodation (medium)

**To run:** `cd /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/strategy-engine && node orchestrator.js`

## Key Insights About Jaz's Workflow

### Hyperfocus Window
- **Duration:** 2-3 weeks before burnout
- **Problem:** 100% goes to building, 0% to polishing
- **Solution:** Build 1 week, polish 1 week (same window, different allocation)
- **Rule:** Test-first or test-with, never test-after (won't go back)
- **Scope:** Cut ambition to 50%, use saved time for polish

### "AI Cheating" Feeling
- Jaz feels like using AI for design conversations is "cheating"
- Reframe: Same as whiteboarding with colleague, rubber ducking, pair programming
- The war says any help = invalidates the "proof" of competence
- Reality: AI was thinking partner, Jaz still implemented everything
