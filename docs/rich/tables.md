Tables



Rich’s

Table

class offers a variety of ways to render tabular data to the terminal.

To render a table, construct a

Table

object, add columns with

add_column()

, and rows with

add_row()

– then print it to the console.

Here’s an example:

from

rich.console

import

Console

from

rich.table

import

Table

table

=

Table

(

title

=

"Star Wars Movies"

)

table

.

add_column

(

"Released"

,

justify

=

"right"

,

style

=

"cyan"

,

no_wrap

=

True

)

table

.

add_column

(

"Title"

,

style

=

"magenta"

)

table

.

add_column

(

"Box Office"

,

justify

=

"right"

,

style

=

"green"

)

table

.

add_row

(

"Dec 20, 2019"

,

"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"

,

"$952,110,690"

)

table

.

add_row

(

"May 25, 2018"

,

"Solo: A Star Wars Story"

,

"$393,151,347"

)

table

.

add_row

(

"Dec 15, 2017"

,

"Star Wars Ep. V111: The Last Jedi"

,

"$1,332,539,889"

)

table

.

add_row

(

"Dec 16, 2016"

,

"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"

,

"$1,332,439,889"

)

console

=

Console

()

console

.

print

(

table

)

This produces the following output:

Rich will calculate the optimal column sizes to fit your content, and will wrap text to fit if the terminal is not wide enough to fit the contents.

Note

You are not limited to adding text in the

add_row

method. You can add anything that Rich knows how to render (including another table).

Table Options



There are a number of keyword arguments on the Table constructor you can use to define how a table should look.

title

Sets the title of the table (text shown above the table).

caption

Sets the table caption (text shown below the table).

width

Sets the desired width of the table (disables automatic width calculation).

min_width

Sets a minimum width for the table.

box

Sets one of the

Box

styles for the table grid, or

None

for no grid.

safe_box

Set to

True

to force the table to generate ASCII characters rather than unicode.

padding

An integer, or tuple of 1, 2, or 4 values to set the padding on cells (see

Padding

).

collapse_padding

If True the padding of neighboring cells will be merged.

pad_edge

Set to False to remove padding around the edge of the table.

expand

Set to True to expand the table to the full available size.

show_header

Set to True to show a header, False to disable it.

show_footer

Set to True to show a footer, False to disable it.

show_edge

Set to False to disable the edge line around the table.

show_lines

Set to True to show lines between rows as well as header / footer.

leading

Additional space between rows.

style

A Style to apply to the entire table, e.g. “on blue”

row_styles

Set to a list of styles to style alternating rows. e.g.

["dim",

""]

to create

zebra stripes

header_style

Set the default style for the header.

footer_style

Set the default style for the footer.

border_style

Set a style for border characters.

title_style

Set a style for the title.

caption_style

Set a style for the caption.

title_justify

Set the title justify method (“left”, “right”, “center”, or “full”)

caption_justify

Set the caption justify method (“left”, “right”, “center”, or “full”)

highlight

Set to True to enable automatic highlighting of cell contents.

Border Styles



You can set the border style by importing one of the preset

Box

objects and setting the

box

argument in the table constructor. Here’s an example that modifies the look of the Star Wars table:

from

rich

import

box

table

=

Table

(

title

=

"Star Wars Movies"

,

box

=

box

.

MINIMAL_DOUBLE_HEAD

)

See

Box

for other box styles.

You can also set

box=None

to remove borders entirely.

The

Table

class offers a number of configuration options to set the look and feel of the table, including how borders are rendered and the style and alignment of the columns.

Lines



By default, Tables will show a line under the header only. If you want to show lines between all rows add

show_lines=True

to the constructor.

You can also force a line on the next row by setting

end_section=True

on the call to

add_row()

, or by calling the

add_section()

to add a line between the current and subsequent rows.

Empty Tables



Printing a table with no columns results in a blank line. If you are building a table dynamically and the data source has no columns, you might want to print something different. Here’s how you might do that:

if

table

.

columns

:

print

(

table

)

else

:

print

(

"[i]No data...[/i]"

)

Adding Columns



You may also add columns by specifying them in the positional arguments of the

Table

constructor. For example, we could construct a table with three columns like this:

table

=

Table

(

"Released"

,

"Title"

,

"Box Office"

,

title

=

"Star Wars Movies"

)

This allows you to specify the text of the column only. If you want to set other attributes, such as width and style, you can add a

Column

class. Here’s an example:

from

rich.table

import

Column

,

Table

table

=

Table

(

"Released"

,

"Title"

,

Column

(

header

=

"Box Office"

,

justify

=

"right"

),

title

=

"Star Wars Movies"

)

Column Options



There are a number of options you can set on a column to modify how it will look.

header_style

Sets the style of the header, e.g. “bold magenta”.

footer_style

Sets the style of the footer.

style

Sets a style that applies to the column. You could use this to highlight a column by setting the background with “on green” for example.

justify

Sets the text justify to one of “left”, “center”, “right”, or “full”.

vertical

Sets the vertical alignment of the cells in a column, to one of “top”, “middle”, or “bottom”.

width

Explicitly set the width of a row to a given number of characters (disables automatic calculation).

min_width

When set to an integer will prevent the column from shrinking below this amount.

max_width

When set to an integer will prevent the column from growing beyond this amount.

ratio

Defines a ratio to set the column width. For instance, if there are 3 columns with a total of 6 ratio, and

ratio=2

then the column will be a third of the available size.

no_wrap

Set to True to prevent this column from wrapping.

highlight

Set to True to enable automatic highlighting of cell contents.

Vertical Alignment



You can define the vertical alignment of a column by setting the

vertical

parameter of the column. You can also do this per-cell by wrapping your text or renderable with a

Align

class:

table

.

add_row

(

Align

(

"Title"

,

vertical

=

"middle"

))

Grids



The Table class can also make a great layout tool. If you disable headers and borders you can use it to position content within the terminal. The alternative constructor

grid()

can create such a table for you.

For instance, the following code displays two pieces of text aligned to both the left and right edges of the terminal on a single line:

from

rich

import

print

from

rich.table

import

Table

grid

=

Table

.

grid

(

expand

=

True

)

grid

.

add_column

()

grid

.

add_column

(

justify

=

"right"

)

grid

.

add_row

(

"Raising shields"

,

"[bold magenta]COMPLETED [green]:heavy_check_mark:"

)

print

(

grid

)
