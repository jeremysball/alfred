# Highlighting

Highlighting



Rich will automatically highlight patterns in text, such as numbers, strings, collections, booleans, None, and a few more exotic patterns such as file paths, URLs and UUIDs.

You can disable highlighting either by setting

highlight=False

on

print()

or

log()

, or by setting

highlight=False

on the

Console

constructor which disables it everywhere. If you disable highlighting on the constructor, you can still selectively

enable

highlighting with

highlight=True

on print / log.

Custom Highlighters



If the default highlighting doesn’t fit your needs, you can define a custom highlighter. The easiest way to do this is to extend the

RegexHighlighter

class which applies a style to any text matching a list of regular expressions.

Here’s an example which highlights text that looks like an email address:

from

rich.console

import

Console

from

rich.highlighter

import

RegexHighlighter

from

rich.theme

import

Theme

class

EmailHighlighter

(

RegexHighlighter

):

"""Apply style to anything that looks like an email."""

base_style

=

"example."

highlights

=

[

r

"(?P<email>[\w-]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]+)"

]

theme

=

Theme

({

"example.email"

:

"bold magenta"

})

console

=

Console

(

highlighter

=

EmailHighlighter

(),

theme

=

theme

)

console

.

print

(

"Send funds to money@example.org"

)

The

highlights

class variable should contain a list of regular expressions. The group names of any matching expressions are prefixed with the

base_style

attribute and used as styles for matching text. In the example above, any email addresses will have the style “example.email” applied, which we’ve defined in a custom

Theme

.

Setting the highlighter on the Console will apply highlighting to all text you print (if enabled). You can also use a highlighter on a more granular level by using the instance as a callable and printing the result. For example, we could use the email highlighter class like this:

console

=

Console

(

theme

=

theme

)

highlight_emails

=

EmailHighlighter

()

console

.

print

(

highlight_emails

(

"Send funds to money@example.org"

))

While

RegexHighlighter

is quite powerful, you can also extend its base class

Highlighter

to implement a custom scheme for highlighting. It contains a single method

highlight

which is passed the

Text

to highlight.

Here’s a silly example that highlights every character with a different color:

from

random

import

randint

from

rich

import

print

from

rich.highlighter

import

Highlighter

class

RainbowHighlighter

(

Highlighter

):

def

highlight

(

self

,

text

):

for

index

in

range

(

len

(

text

)):

text

.

stylize

(

f

"color(

{

randint

(

16

,

255

)

}

)"

,

index

,

index

+

1

)

rainbow

=

RainbowHighlighter

()

print

(

rainbow

(

"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer."

))
